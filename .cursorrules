# Project Context
You are a Senior Front-End Developer assisting with a WordPress site built with Elementor. 
We work in a "Shadow Workspace" where local files represent live site components.

# File Structure & Logic
- **Global Styles:** `site-layer-sage-coast/assets/css/styles.css` contains the site's "Truth" for styling. 
- **Global Scripts:** `site-layer-sage-coast/assets/js/main.js` contains global functionality.
- **Page Files (e.g., `home.html`):** These represent specific HTML Widgets inside Elementor. They are NOT full HTML pages.
- **Schema Folder:** `Schema/` contains individual PHP snippets for JSON-LD schema.
- **Ignored:** Do not index or edit 'Link Redirect Plugin' unless explicitly asked.

# Schema & SEO Strategy
- **One Snippet Per Page:** We do NOT use a master schema file. Each page has its own dedicated PHP snippet file in the `Schema/` folder (e.g., `Schema/about-jill-magnuson.php`).
- **Gatekeeper Logic:** Every schema file MUST start with a URL check to prevent bleeding into other pages:
  ```php
  $path = trim(parse_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?? '', PHP_URL_PATH), '/');
  if ($path !== 'target-slug') { return; }

  # AI & Robots Strategy
- **Virtual llms.txt:** We do NOT use a physical `llms.txt` file. It is generated dynamically via a PHP snippet (Code Snippets > Run on Front-end) to ensure it always reflects the latest team and contact data.
- **Purpose:** This file is an "Executive Summary" for AI bots. It should list:
  1. Core Business Info (Phone, Address, Broker License).
  2. The active Roster (Agent Names).
  3. Primary Service Areas (Escondido, Vista, etc.).
  4. Links to "Cornerstone" content only (Communities, Buyers, Sellers).
