                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Sage Coast Realty was founded on a simple but often overlooked truth. North County San Diego is not one market.</p>

                    <p>It is a collection of micro-climates, zoning realities, and lifestyle trade-offs that shape how a property actually lives over time. Choosing the right home here requires more than enthusiasm. It requires context, patience, and experience.</p>

                    <p>Sage Coast Realty bridges the gap between inland tranquility and coastal sophistication. We help clients understand not just where a home is located, but how it will function day to day, season to season, and years into ownership.</p>

                    <p>This approach is led by broker and founder Jill Magnuson, whose nearly three decades in real estate have been shaped by pattern recognition, long-term thinking, and a calm, steady presence in complex transactions.</p>

                    <p>Rather than rushing decisions or simplifying nuance, Jill’s role is to clarify what matters most so clients can move forward with confidence.</p>

                    <h3>What clients rely on Sage Coast for</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear explanations of complex property variables</li>
                        <li>Honest discussion of long-term livability and resale considerations</li>
                        <li>Deep familiarity with North County’s inland and coastal transitions</li>
                        <li>Thoughtful negotiation grounded in experience, not pressure</li>
                    </ul>

                            <h3>Jill Magnuson</h3>
                            <div class="position">Broker & Founder</div>
                            <p>Sage Coast Realty is led by Jill Magnuson, a California broker with nearly 30 years of experience guiding buyers and sellers through high-stakes real estate decisions with clarity, composure, and care.</p>

                            <p>Jill has built her career in California, refining an advisory approach grounded in preparation, education, and long-term thinking. Today, her practice is focused in North County San Diego, where inland and coastal markets overlap and successful outcomes often depend on a nuanced understanding of land use, operating costs, climate, and lifestyle fit.</p>

                            <p>Clients often describe Jill’s presence as steady and reassuring. She is known for identifying details buyers may overlook, explaining trade-offs clearly and without pressure, and maintaining control through emotionally charged or technically complex transactions.</p>

                            <p>Just as important is how Jill negotiates. She approaches every deal strategically—thinking beyond price alone to structure terms, timing, and leverage in ways that protect her clients and frequently net them more money. Whether it’s positioning a home to create stronger demand, anticipating buyer objections before they arise, or finding creative solutions when challenges appear, Jill is known for thinking outside the box while keeping her clients’ best interests front and center.</p>

                            <p>Her practice includes residential resales, estate-level properties, and rural or semi-rural homes, with added expertise in sustainability, energy efficiency, and long-term ownership costs—factors that increasingly influence smart real estate decisions.</p>

                            <p>Jill is licensed in California and Hawaii. While her primary focus remains North County San Diego, this broader licensing reflects a career built on experience, perspective, and thoughtful guidance—not expansion for expansion’s sake.</p>
